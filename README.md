Sink Test
---------

An Asynchronous JavaScript Unit Testing Framework.

Sink test is used to test JavaScript that is run asynchronously in the browser whereby you tell the test a number of expectations and Sink will tell you if they each pass successfully.

It is used in other projects of mine such as [$script.js](http://github.com/polvero/script.js) and [Kizzy](http://github.com/polvero/kizzy) due to the async nature of dynamic script loading ($script) and asserting expired data from local storage (Kizzy).
